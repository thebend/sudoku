1. map val function instead of list comprehension
1. load board vs helper function because class init vs functional
1. list of all possible value options with default args
1. scrap individual row col box functions
1. generators for primitive types?
1. xy ordering is unintuitive
1. list of lines vs xy coordinates

1. filtering with lambda to check for set was slower than list comprehension
1. looking up point on board to decide whether to call function which looked up point
   was faster than always calling function, which looked up point once and stopped sometimes
