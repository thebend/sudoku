===Sudoku Solver===
I wrote a Java-based Sudoku solver as a teaching tool a decade ago, but it would only solve unambiguous puzzles (those where you never HAD to try multiple options to see which worked - there was always a definite answer to at least one more piece on the board until it was solved).

Now, after reviewing some of my old code and watching Jack Diederich's "Stop Writing Classes" talk (https://youtu.be/o9pEzgHorH0) I've decided to take another stab at it in Python, try to branch, and try to compare efficiency between using a class which tracks value, options, and position, or a simple array of options.
